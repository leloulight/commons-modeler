<h1>Proposal for <em>Modeler</em> Package</h1>
</div>

<h3>(0) Rationale</h3>

<p>Among the myriad of Java APIs available is the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/">Java Management
Extensions</a> (JMX) APIs, which define "an architecture, the design patterns,
the APIs, and the services for application and network management in the
Java programming language."  These APIs include standards for designing
"Managed Beans" (MBeans) that are associated with components of your
application that you wish to make manageable via a variety of tools (either
local or remote.</p>

<p>The JMX architecture includes a variety of design patterns for MBeans.  The
two most commonly used patterns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Standard MBeans</em> - The developer designs an interface that
    corresponds with the class for each managed resource, exposing only the
    attributes and operations required for management.  The managed resource
    class must implement this interface, according to standard Java
    language rules, for this resource to become manageable.</li>
<li><em>Model MBeans</em> - A generic, configurable MBean which can be
    used to make almost any resource manageable.  Rather than relying on
    implementing a Java interface, Model MBeans utilize <em>metadata</em>
    about the constructors, attributes, and operations that are supported
    to make calls on the managed resource's class, using Java's reflection
    APIs to call arbitrary methods with arbitrary arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, Model MBeans sound incredibly useful -- they require no
changes at all to the Java class representing the managed resource, and you
can use a standard base class provided with the JMX implementation to perform
almost all of your management requirements.  However, the developer is still
required to provide the metadata, which can be tedious to create when there
are many managed resources, with many attributes and operations made available
by those resources.  This is where the <strong>Modeler</strong> comes in.</p>

<p><strong>Modeler</strong> provides the following services to the application
developer who wishes to make their applications manageable via JMX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reads an XML-based description of the Model MBeans to be provided for a
    set of managed resource classes, defining all of the constructors,
    attributes (i.e. properties) and operations (i.e. methods) to be exposed
    to a management application.  Note that, in many cases, additions to or
    removals from the set of APIs exposed for management can be made with no
    code changes.</li>
<li>Provides a registry of these descriptions that allows the
    <code>javax.management.modelmbean.ModelMBeanInfo</code> object required
    by the JMX architecture to be synthesized in one or two lines of
    code.</li>
<li>Supplies a base Model MBean implementation class that can be used for
    all management activities where the attribute accesses or operation calls
    are simply reflected on to the managed object, but can also serve as a
    superclass for cases where the MBean needs to perform additional
    functionality, such as event notification, in addition to calling the
    appropriate method on the managed resource class.</li>
</ul>


<h3>(1) Scope of the Package</h3>

<p>The <em>Modeler</em> project shall create and maintain a set of Java
classes to provide the facilities described in the preceeding section, plus
unit tests and small examples of using these facilities to instrument
Java classes with Model MBean support.</p>


<h3>(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages</h3>

<p><em>Modeler</em> relies on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java Development Kit (Version 1.2 or later)</li>
  <li>A JAXP 1.1 implementation</li>
  <li>A SAX 2.0 parser conforming to the JAXP 1.1 APIs</li>
  <li>BeanUtils from Commons - for instrospection information</li>
  <li>Collections from Commons - for object collections</li>
  <li>Digester from Commons - for parsing scripts in XML</li>
  <li>A JMX compliant implementation, like the 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/download.html">
  JMX Instrumentation and Agent Specification reference implementation</a> or 
  <a href="http://www.open-jmx.org">OpenJMX</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>(2) Initial Source of the Package</h3>

<p>This package represents original code that will be used initially to
instrument the Tomcat 4 servlet container with JMX manageability for all
major components.</p>

<p>The proposed package name for the new component is
<code>org.apache.commons.modeler</code>.

<h3>(3) Required Jakarta-Commons Resources</h3>

<ul>

<li>CVS Repository - New directory <code>modeler</code> in the 
<code>jakarta-commons</code> CVS repository.</li>

<li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
<em>commons-dev@jakarta.apache.org</em> mailing list. To help list
subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that the
message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
[Modeler].</li>

<li>Bugzilla - New component "Modeler" under the "Commons" product
category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>

<li>Jyve FAQ - New category "commons-modeler" (when available).</li>
</ul>


<h3>(4) Initial Committers</h3>

<p>The initial committers on the Workflow component shall be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Craig R. McClanahan</li>
  <li>Remy Maucherat</li>
</ul>
