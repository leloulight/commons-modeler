<section name="The Modeler Component">

<p>Java Management Extensions (JMX) is an API that facilitates building
management applications that can configure, and perform operations on, a
server application.  In general, each manageable component of the server
application is represented by a <em>Management Bean</em> (or MBean, for
short).  JMX defines three types of MBeans, of which <em>Model MBeans</em>
are the most flexible.  Model MBeans provide a way to define MBeans for
many different components, without having to write a specific MBean
implementation class for each one.</p>

<p>However, this power comes at a price.  It is necessary to set up a
substantial amount of metadata about each MBean, including the attributes
it should expose (similar to JavaBeans properties), the operations it should
make available (similar to calling methods of a Java object via reflection),
and other related information.  The <em>Modeler</em> component is designed to
make this process fairly painless -- the required metadata is configured from
an XML description of each Model MBean to be supported.  In addition,
Modeler provides a factory mechanism to create the actual Model MBean instances
themselves.</p>
